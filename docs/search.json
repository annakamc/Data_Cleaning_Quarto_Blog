    "text": "Intro:\nI’m Annaka—a technical data analyst at John Deere by day and a full-time student at BYU-I by night. Every day, I dive into complex data sets, transforming raw numbers into clear insights that drive strategic decision-making. Whether I’m using Databricks, GitHub, or AWS Textract, I absolutely love crafting regex to suit my needs and learning what more I can do with it.\nData isn’t just numbers to me; it’s like a puzzle waiting to be solved or a piece of art waiting to be understood. My passion lies in leveraging data to make meaningful impacts, constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in data engineering, data science, and machine learning/artificial intelligence. This blog is my space to share the challenges, discoveries, and triumphs of cleaning and wrangling data into actionable stories.\nI invite you to join me on this journey. Let’s connect, collaborate, and geek out over everything from SQL and Python to Machine Learning, R, and more. If you’re passionate about data, love a good regex challenge, or just want to chat about the latest in ETL, data mining, and visualization techniques, feel free to reach out. Together, we can turn messy data into something truly extraordinary!\n### To give myself some credibility (aka why you should pay attention just a little)…\nI’ve placed in four out of six hackathons, including one where my team’s machine learning code was actually implemented in production at Koch Industries—an experience that still blows my mind.\nI’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science with minors in Statistics and Business Analytics at BYU-Idaho. I will graduate in July with a 3.97 GPA while also having a job at John Deere as a technical data analyst working approximately 30 hours a week and also working on campus as the data lab tutor. Along the way, I’ve earned certificates in Machine Learning and Databases from BYU-I, and completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate—which unexpectedly launched me into some wild and wonderful opportunities.\nThat certificate led to me being featured in a Google YouTube episode, and eventually participating in AI beta testing with Google. I’ve also done consulting work for over 5 companies, where I developed not just technical solutions, but also sharpened my communication, business vocabulary, KPI design, and creative problem-solving to meet each organization’s unique goals and resources.\nMy expertise in data and storytelling has opened doors for internal and external PR opportunities with Coursera, where I’ve had articles written about my journey (linked on my LinkedIn page).\nI’m also currently leading a pilot program for BYU-Idaho—and potentially all BYU schools—to make Coursera freely available for students, aiming to bridge the gap between personalized learning and real-world, industry-ready experience.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
